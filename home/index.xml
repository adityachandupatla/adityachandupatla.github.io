      <description>On Quora, by and large, I write about Computer Science, Data Science, AI/ML, Jobs &amp;amp; careers, Education, Technology, Life and Marvel movies.  What are some things about coding that you learned from good programmers around you? How does logistic regression work (step by step)? In linear regression, how is the learning rate defined? Is it calculated or predicted? As a software engineer, what is the most alarming thing you have ever seen in a codebase?</description>
