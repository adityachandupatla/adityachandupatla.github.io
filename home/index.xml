      <description>Biography Software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in distributed computing and database industry. I bring academic expertise coupled with Industry best-practises to the table. I&amp;rsquo;m actively seeking full-time software engineer positions (starting anytime from May) in one or more of the following domains: distributed systems, infrastructure engineering, data platform engineering, and machine-learning/data-science.
Currently pursuing my graduate studies at University of Southern California (Expected graduation: May 2021.) Some of the challenging courses at USC which have pushed me to really learn the fundamentals are: Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Analysis of Algorithms, and Web development.</description>

      <description>What are some things about coding that you learned from good programmers around you? How does logistic regression work (step by step)? In linear regression, how is the learning rate defined? Is it calculated or predicted? How can I get an internship if I am focusing only on competitive coding? What are some interesting codes you have written in C? What are some practical applications of hashing?  Interested? Follow me here</description>
